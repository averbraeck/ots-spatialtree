# ots-spatialtree

Development of a spatial tree for OpenTrafficSim.

This has been set-up as a side project to the opentrafficsim repo to test and compare the different implementations of spatial trees for their use in OTS. 

The tested libraries are, a.o.:

- JSI (RTree)
- JTS (STRtree, HBRtree)
- h2 (mvstore / MVRTreeMap)
- davidmoten/rtree
- possibly others
